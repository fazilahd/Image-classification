# Prediction Models Repository

## Overview
This repository contains machine learning projects focused on predictive modeling for different scenarios. The projects included are:

1. **Bike Purchasement Prediction**: Predicts bike purchases using customer data. Includes a Jupyter notebook for model training and a Streamlit app for predictions.

2. **Salary Prediction**: Predicts employee salaries based on various features. Features a Jupyter notebook for data analysis and model training, along with a Streamlit app for salary estimation.

3. **Scholarship Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of receiving a scholarship based on exam scores and other features. Includes a Jupyter notebook for model training and FastAPI for API deployment.
